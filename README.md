# mill-hepek

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/ba.sake/mill-hepek/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/ba.sake/mill-hepek)  

An Mill plugin for writing Scala `object`s to files.  
See also [**hepek**](https://github.com/sake92/hepek), static content generator that builds upon this plugin.



## Installation

Add the following to your `build.sc`:

```scala
import $ivy.`ba.sake::mill-hepek::0.0.1`
import mill._
import mill.scalalib._
import ba.sake.millhepek.MillHepekModule

object site extends MillHepekModule with ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = ...
}
```


## Usage

The main task of mill-hepek is `hepek`.  
When executed, it will:
1. copy all files from `src/resources/public` to `hepek_output` folder
1. write all `object .. extends Renderable` from the `files` package to `hepek_output` folder
1. write accessors for `src/resources/public` files, so you don't have to type it, or make mistakes


Minimal example:

```scala
package files // mandatory !!

import java.nio.file.Paths
import ba.sake.hepek.core.Renderable

object RenderMe extends Renderable {

  // access `src/resources/public` files through autogenerated files.<TAB>
  override def render =
    "Some text" // arbitrary Scala code
  
  override def relPath = 
    Paths.get("renderme.txt")
}
```

When you run `./mill site.hepek`, you'll find the `site/hepek_output/renderme.txt` file,  
with text `Some text`.

## Fun fact
I think that this is the first project that tried this approach, namely, using first-class Scala `object`s for this kind of stuff.  
Correct me if I'm wrong... ^_^

## About the name

A "hepek" in Bosnian language is a jargon for a thing/thingy/stuff...  
It is used when we don't know the name of a thing: "Give me that ... *hepek*".  
Also, it is used in the famous show called "Top lista nadrealista" as a name for an advanced device which calms down situations of various kinds.
